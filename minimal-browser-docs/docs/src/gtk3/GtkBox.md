class val GtkBox is GtkWidget
"""
The GtkBox widget arranges child widgets into a single row or column,
depending upon the value of its #GtkOrientable:orientation property. Within
the other dimension, all children are allocated the same size. Of course,
the #GtkWidget:halign and #GtkWidget:valign properties can be used on
the children to influence their allocation.

GtkBox uses a notion of packing. Packing refers
to adding widgets with reference to a particular position in a
#GtkContainer. For a GtkBox, there are two reference positions: the
start and the end of the box.
For a vertical #GtkBox, the start is defined as the top of the box and
the end is defined as the bottom. For a horizontal #GtkBox the start
is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right side.

Use repeated calls to gtk_box_pack_start() to pack widgets into a
GtkBox from start to end. Use gtk_box_pack_end() to add widgets from
end to start. You may intersperse these calls and add widgets from
both ends of the same GtkBox.

Because GtkBox is a #GtkContainer, you may also use gtk_container_add()
to insert widgets into the box, and they will be packed with the default
values for expand and fill child properties. Use gtk_container_remove()
to remove widgets from the GtkBox.

Use gtk_box_set_homogeneous() to specify whether or not all children
of the GtkBox are forced to get the same amount of space.

Use gtk_box_set_spacing() to determine how much space will be
minimally placed between all children in the GtkBox. Note that
spacing is added between the children, while
padding added by gtk_box_pack_start() or gtk_box_pack_end() is added
on either side of the widget it belongs to.

Use gtk_box_reorder_child() to move a GtkBox child to a different
place in the box.

Use gtk_box_set_child_packing() to reset the expand,
fill and padding child properties.
Use gtk_box_query_child_packing() to query these fields.

# CSS nodes

GtkBox uses a single CSS node with name box.

In horizontal orientation, the nodes of the children are always arranged
from left to right. So :first-child will always select the leftmost child,
regardless of text direction.
