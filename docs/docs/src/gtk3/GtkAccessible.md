The #GtkAccessible class is the base class for accessible
implementations for #GtkWidget subclasses. It is a thin
wrapper around #AtkObject, which adds facilities for associating
a widget with its accessible object.

An accessible implementation for a third-party widget should
derive from #GtkAccessible and implement the suitable interfaces
from ATK, such as #AtkText or #AtkSelection. To establish
the connection between the widget class and its corresponding
acccessible implementation, override the get_accessible vfunc
in #GtkWidgetClass.
